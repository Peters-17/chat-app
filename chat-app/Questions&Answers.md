# Solutions to Development Challenges in my Chat Application

This document explains how the issues encountered during development were resolved, along with additional professional-level considerations.

### 1. **Too Many Test Chrome Pages with No Messages or Room List Loading**

**Solution**: 
This issue likely arose because the tests were spawning new Chrome pages repeatedly without properly closing the previous ones. To resolve this, I ensured that each test session was isolated and properly closed after completion. I also added logic to wait for the page to fully load (including room lists and message history) before interacting with elements.

**Steps**:
- Used hooks (`before` and `after`) in the `hook.js` file to open and close each browser instance only once per test suite, avoiding excessive page instances.
- Configured explicit waits for the room list and message elements to be present before proceeding with further test actions, which allowed the data to load completely before any further interactions.

### 2. **Login Tests Closing Prematurely Without Testing the Room**

**Solution**:
This problem occurred because the login tests completed and closed the page before testing the room features. To address this, I implemented a sequence where, after login, the test waits for the main chat interface (room and message sections) to load before continuing with room-specific tests.

**Steps**:
- Adjusted the `login_steps.js` to include additional steps after login, specifically waiting for an element (such as the room list) to verify successful login and ensure the room interface is ready for testing.
- Ensured that the room tests depend on a successful login check before execution to prevent premature page closure.

### 3. **Handling Multiple Users Chatting (Multiple Clients) Simultaneously**

**Solution**:
To simulate multiple users interacting at the same time, I instantiated multiple browser instances using the same testing framework and established separate connections to the chat server via `socket.io`. Each instance was assigned a unique username, allowing distinct user sessions.

**Steps**:
- Created multiple instances in the `multi_user_steps.js` file, where each instance represents a different user. This allows simultaneous actions (sending and receiving messages) to be tested.
- Used unique session cookies for each instance to prevent session conflicts and ensure user-specific data loading.
- Added specific waits and assertions to verify that messages sent by one user were correctly received by others in the same room, validating real-time communication across multiple clients.

### 4. **Message History Not Loading in Time for Test Assertion**
In real-time applications, delays in loading message history can cause tests to fail due to asynchronous behavior. When joining a chat room, messages may not fully load before the test checks for their presence.

**Solution**: To address this, increase the wait time for the message elements to load completely. Use driver.wait with until.elementsLocated to wait up to 10 seconds for .message_holder elements to appear, ensuring the messages are fully loaded before the assertion:

```javascript
Then('I should see the message history for that room', async function () {
  await driver.wait(until.elementsLocated(By.css('.message_holder')), 5000);
  const messages = await driver.findElements(By.css('.message_holder'));
  expect(messages.length).to.be.greaterThan(0);
});
```
- This solution enhances test reliability when verifying message history in asynchronous, real-time environments.

### 5. **Cucumber Confusing Similar Feature Sentences**

**Solution**:
With similar feature sentences across multiple `.feature` files (e.g., login and room tests), Cucumber sometimes matched steps with the wrong step definition file. To avoid this, I refined the phrasing in each `.feature` file to make each sentence uniquely identifiable by Cucumber.

**Steps**:
- Updated the wording of each step in `login.feature`, `message.feature`, and other feature files to ensure they were distinct.
- Grouped related steps into separate step definition files (e.g., `login_steps.js`, `unique_room_steps.js`), making it easier for Cucumber to link the appropriate feature steps with the correct step definitions.
- Verified that each step definition uniquely handled one part of the testing flow, reducing ambiguity in step matching.

### 6. **Preventing Duplicate Room Creation in Chat Application**

Duplicate rooms were displayed in the chat application despite a unique constraint on the room name in the database. This issue appeared to be caused by a race condition due to a synchronization delay between the in-memory rooms array and the database. As a result, the server-side code sometimes allowed the creation of duplicate rooms before the in-memory data could be fully updated.

**Solution**:
- The in-memory rooms array was removed, and all room data is now fetched directly from the database each time an update is needed. This ensures that room creation logic strictly relies on the database's unique constraint, effectively preventing duplicate rooms without additional client-side handling.

**Steps**:

- Removed the in-memory rooms array, avoiding potential race conditions and eliminating reliance on unsynchronized in-memory data.
- Modified the createRoom event in server.js to directly query the database (Room.findOne) to check for existing rooms with the same name before creating a new one.
- Updated room broadcasting logic to fetch all rooms from the database each time a new room is created or the room list is updated.

This approach ensures that clients only receive a consistent, unique list of rooms directly from the database.

### 7. **Think about how to design test for handling a large user base**

**Solution**:
- To design effective tests for handling a large user base in a chat application, load testing with tools like Apache JMeter, Gatling, or Locust is essential. These tools simulate high traffic scenarios such as concurrent logins, high message throughput, and room switching to identify system bottlenecks. By configuring tests to increase user loads gradually, we can measure server response times, resource usage, and message delivery delays, ensuring the application handles high traffic without performance degradation.

- Scalability testing is another critical approach, especially for distributed architectures. By setting up multiple server instances behind a load balancer and using Redis Pub/Sub for cross-instance message management, we can test the system's ability to maintain state across instances and support real-time interactions at scale. Monitoring memory, CPU, and network usage under this setup verifies that the system can scale horizontally and handle high numbers of concurrent users seamlessly.

- Finally, endurance and error handling tests ensure long-term stability and graceful recovery. Running moderate load tests over extended periods helps detect memory leaks and assess long-term resource consumption, ensuring stability. Additionally, simulating failures such as server crashes, database timeouts, or Redis disruptions tests the applicationâ€™s resilience, confirming it can recover user sessions and maintain message integrity under adverse conditions. Together, these strategies validate the chat application's reliability and scalability, making it robust for production use.
