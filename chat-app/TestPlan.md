# BDD Test Plan for Chat Application

## Purpose
This test plan is designed to validate the core functionality and user experience of the chat application, ensuring it can handle user login, room management, real-time messaging, and multi-user interactions reliably. 

## Scope
This plan covers:
- User authentication
- Room creation and navigation
- Message sending and retrieval (including message history)
- Multi-user interactions
- System performance and reliability in a real-time environment

## Key Features and Scenarios

### 1. User Authentication

#### Feature: User Login
**Scenario 1.1**: User logs in successfully
- **Given** a user with registered credentials
- **When** the user enters valid credentials
- **Then** they should be logged in and redirected to the main chat interface

**Scenario 1.2**: Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials
- **Given** a user without valid credentials
- **When** they enter incorrect username or password
- **Then** an error message should appear, indicating login failure

#### Feature: User Logout
**Scenario 1.3**: User logs out successfully
- **Given** a user who is logged in
- **When** they click on the logout button
- **Then** they should be logged out and redirected to the login page

### 2. Room Management

#### Feature: Room Creation
**Scenario 2.1**: Create a new chat room
- **Given** a user is logged in
- **When** they enter a unique room name and select “Create Room”
- **Then** the new room should be created and appear in the active rooms list

**Scenario 2.2**: Prevent duplicate room names
- **Given** a room already exists with the name "TestRoom"
- **When** a user attempts to create another room with the same name
- **Then** an error message should display, indicating the room name is taken

#### Feature: Room Navigation
**Scenario 2.3**: Join an existing chat room and check history
- **Given** a user is logged in
- **When** they select an existing room from the room list
- **Then** they should enter the room and view any existing message history

### 3. Messaging

#### Feature: Sending Messages
**Scenario 3**: User sends a message in a room 
- **Given** a user has joined a room
- **When** they enter a message and press send
- **Then** the message should appear in the chat window and be visible to all other users in that room

### 4. Multi-User Interaction

#### Feature: Real-Time Messaging
**Scenario 4.1**: Real-time message delivery across multiple users
- **Given** multiple users are in the same room
- **When** one user sends a message
- **Then** all users in that room should see the message appear in real-time

**Scenario 4.2**: Room entry and exit announcements
- **Given** a user joins or leaves a room
- **Then** an announcement should be displayed to all other users in the room, indicating the user’s action

### 5. System Performance and Reliability

#### Feature: Stability with High User Volume
**Scenario 5.1**: Ensure performance under high user volume
- **Given** a high number of users join and interact in various rooms
- **When** users send messages and switch rooms concurrently
- **Then** the system should maintain responsiveness, and messages should be delivered without delay

#### Feature: Consistent Message History Loading
**Scenario 5.2**: Ensure reliable message history loading
- **Given** a user joins a room with a substantial message history
- **When** the room loads
- **Then** all messages should load correctly and no messages should be missing or duplicated

---

## Acceptance Criteria

Each test scenario should pass if:
- The application behavior matches the defined steps in each scenario
- All user actions result in appropriate responses within acceptable time limits
- No errors or unexpected behaviors occur during execution

## Testing Tools and Configuration

- **Testing Framework**: Cucumber for BDD scenario management
- **Driver**: Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
- **Assertions**: Chai for validating expected outcomes
- **Sockets**: Socket.IO for managing real-time messaging during multi-user scenarios

## Execution and Reporting
Each scenario will be executed in the Cucumber test environment, with results logged and reported. The report will include:
- Pass/fail status for each scenario
- Error details for failed steps
- Screenshots for failures to assist in debugging

## Summary
This BDD test plan covers essential features of the chat application, ensuring reliability and performance across user login, room management, and real-time communication. This plan validates that the system meets functional and performance requirements to provide a robust, responsive user experience.
